# Skipio React Dev Skills Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Read more about how it works and why it is useful there.

## Quick Start

```
$ cd path/to/skipio-react-dev-skills-assessment/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Notes to the test evaluator

I pushed the api token to github.  
As soon as I realized I did, I deleted the original repo and cleared the token.  
This repo has never contained the token.  

This is a summary of the old git history:
- Update docs
- Improve ContactListPage
- Add ContactDetailsPage
- Show contact list on /contacts
- Improve home page appearance
- Stub navigation
- Remove unnecessary files
- Remove attempt at absolute path resolution
- Add project created by create-react-app

## Future improvements

- Tests (Jest)
- Add pagination to contacts list
- Check for empty contact list and display something useful to user
- Improve error handling (use error messages from server where appropriate)
